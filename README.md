Having nothing better to do, I decided to give a try to Pyglet. This simple game is still under development.
Feel free to contribute to the project if you find it funny / interesting enough.

The game board consists of `6 + n * 3` cells in 6 types. Each 2 x 2 group, if contains at least 3 cells, can be rotated 
left or right (left/right mouse click), 90 degrees in one step. 3 or more cells of the same type, arranged in 
a horizontal row, disappear. All the cells above fall down. The game objective is to destroy all the cells and unlock 
the next level. Next board size will be `n+3 x n+3`.

A lot of work still left to do. See the current development state in action: https://youtu.be/IVEoVfDqq8Y
